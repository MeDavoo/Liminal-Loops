Liminal Loops a 3D unity colaborative game development

A game where the player has the ability to restart the day as many times as they want in hopes of discovering the mysterious entity responsible for the horrific and psychological problems plaguing the island.

Along the way, the player encounters a handful of NPCs, each with their own routine and backstory. However, one of the NPCs is randomly selected at the start of the game to be a "demon" in disguise, and the player must use their time-looping ability to uncover clues and figure out which NPC is the culprit.

Under development by MeDavoo, Hotdogzee and Xvector
